    abstract = {{In most container yards around the world, containers are stacked high to utilize yard space more efficiently. In these yards, one major factor that affects their operational efficiency is the need to re-shuffle containers when accessing a container that is buried beneath other containers. One way to achieve higher loading efficiency is to pre-marshal the containers in such a way that it fits the loading sequence. In this research, we present a mathematical model for the container pre-marshalling problem. With respect to a given yard layout and a given sequence that containers are loaded onto a ship, the model yields a plan to re-position the export containers within the yard, so that no extra re-handles will be needed during the loading operation. The optimization goal is to minimize the number of container movements during pre-marshalling. The resulting model is an integer programming model composed of a multi-commodity flow problem and a set of side constraints. Several possible variations of the model as well as a solution heuristic are also discussed. Computation results are provided.}},

    abstract = {{In order to speed up the loading operation of export containers onto a ship, the re-marshaling operation is an usual practice in port container terminals. It is assumed that the current yard map for containers is available and a desirable bay layout is provided. A methodology is proposed to convert the current bay layout into the desirable layout by moving the fewest possible number of containers and in the shortest possible travel distance. The problem is decomposed into three sub-problems such as the bay matching, the move planning, and the task sequencing. The bay matching is to match a specific current bay with a bay configuration in the target layout. In the move planning stage, the number of containers to be moved from a specific bay to another is determined. The completion time of the re-marshaling operation is minimized by sequencing the moving tasks in the final stage. A mathematical model is suggested for each sub-problem. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the solution procedure.}},

@article{Kang2006,
    abstract = {{In a container terminal, export containers are usually classified into one of a few weight groups and those belonging to the same group are stored together on a same stack. The reason for this stacking by weight groups is that it becomes easy to have heavier containers be loaded onto a ship before lighter ones, which is important for the balancing of the ship. However, since the weight information available at the time of container arrival is only an estimate, containers belonging to different weight groups are often stored together on a same stack. This becomes the cause of extra moves, or re-handlings, of containers at the time of loading to fetch out the heavier containers placed under the lighter ones. In this paper, we propose a method based on a simulated annealing search to derive a good stacking strategy for containers with uncertain weight information. Simulation experiments have shown that our strategies more effectively reduce the number of re-handlings than the traditional same-weight-group-stacking strategy. Also, additional experiments have shown that further improvement can be obtained if we increase the accuracy of the weight classification by applying machine learning.}},

As a result, extra rehandles may occur when lifting them up for loading onto ships. One way to improve operational efficiency is to pre-marshal the containers in such an order that it fits the loading sequence. This paper proposes a model to develop a movement plan to improve the layout of containers in a bay. The proposed heuristic consists of a neighborhood search process, an integer programming model, and three minor subroutines. Each of the components plays a different role in the heuristic. Several sets of testing results demonstrate the performance of the heuristic as well as the contributions of the components.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Fast handling of vessels is one of the most important goals in container terminal operations planning. In recent studies, quay crane double cycling has been investigated to accelerate the service of vessels. In our paper, we show that the service process can be further accelerated by changing the treatment of so-called reshuffle containers. Reshuffle containers have to be removed from their position in the vessel only to gain access to containers stacked below them. Our approach enables to reposition reshuffle containers directly within the bay of a vessel, referred to as internal reshuffles, instead of temporarily unloading them. A mathematical problem formulation and a heuristic solution method, namely a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure, are provided for planning crane operations under internal reshuffles. Computational tests prove that the consideration of internal reshuffles leads to a further shortening of vessel handling times compared to a sole application of crane double cycling.}},

    abstract = {{This paper presents a three-phase heuristic to solve for an optimized working plan for a crane to retrieve all the containers from a given yard according to a given order. The optimization goal is to minimize the number of container movements, as well as the crane's working time. After generating an initial feasible movement sequence, the second phase reduces the length of the sequence by repeatedly formulating and generating a binary integer program. With another mixed integer program, phase three reduces the crane's working time by adjusting the movement sequence through iterations. Numerical testing results show that the heuristic is able to solve instances with more than 700 containers, which is within the range of real-world applications. Moreover, the number of movements approaches the lower bound in most cases, and the resulting movement sequence is efficient.}},
