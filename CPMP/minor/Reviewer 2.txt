Reviewer #2: The authors have carefully revised their paper. They resolved all questions that I raised in my previous review. Furthermore, the style of writing was improved significantly throughout the whole paper. Anyhow, the added results show that the new lower bound yields hardly any improvement compared with bounds proposed in earlier papers (see Table 2) and I therefore recommend that the authors reduce the praising of their bound in the abstract and the conclusions. Another minor issue is to replace 'receptively' by 'respectively' on page 18. Since the new method outperforms the so-far available methods and because the practicability of the new approach is clearly shown in this paper, I recommend accepting this submission for publication.
